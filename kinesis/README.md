## Kinesis Data Stream

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a serverless streaming data service that makes it easy to capture, process, and store data streams at any scale.

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. The throughput of an Amazon Kinesis data stream is designed to scale without limits via increasing the number of shards within a data stream. With Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, you can scale up to a sufficient number of shards (note, however, that you'll need to provision enough shards ahead of time). As it requires manual administration of shards.
