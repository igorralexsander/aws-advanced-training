## AWS Budgets

* Cost budget - Helps you plan how much you want to spend on a service.

* Usage budget - Helps you plan how much you want to use one or more services.

* Reservation budget - This helps you track the usage of your Reserved Instances (RI). Two ways of doing it - RI utilization budgets (This lets you see if your RIs are unused or under-utilized), RI coverage budgets (This lets you see how much of your instance usage is covered by a reservation).
