# AWS Well Architected

## Pillars

* Operational excellence (Excelência operacional)
* Security (Segurança)
* Reliability (Confiabilidade)
* Performance efficiency (Eficiência de performance)
* Cost Optimization (Otimização de custos)
* Sustainability (Sustentabilidade)

### Operational excellence

The operational excellence pillar focuses on running and monitoring systems, and continually improving process and procedures. Key Topics include automating changes, responding to events, and defining standards to manage daily operations.

* Perform operations as code.
* Make frequent, small, reversible, changes.
* Refine operations procedures frequently.
* Antecipate failure.
* Learn from all operational failures.

### Security Pillar

The Security pillar focuses on protecting information and systems. Key topics include confidentiality and integrity of data, managing user permissions, and establishing controls to detect security events.

* Implement a strong identity foundation
* Enable traceability
* Apply security at all layers
* Automate security best practices
* Protect data in transit and at rest
* Keep People away from data
* Prepare for security events

### Reliability pillar

The reliability pillar focuses on workloads performing their intended functions and how to recover quickly from failure to meet demands. Key topics include distributed system design, recovery planning, and adapting to changing requirements.

* Automatically recover from failures
* Test recovery procedures
* Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
* Stop guessing capacity
* Manage change in automation

### Performance Efficiency Pillar

The performance efficiency pillar focuses on structured and streamlined allocation of IT and computing resources. Key Topics include selecting resource types and sizes optimized for workload requirements, monitoring performance, and maintaining efficiency as business needs evolve.

* Democratize advanced technologies
* Go global in minutes
* Use serverless architectures
* Experiment more often
* Consider mechanical sympathy

### Coast Optimization Pillar

The cost optimization pillar focuses on avoiding unnecessary costs. Key Topics include understanding spending over time and controlling fund allocation, selecting resources of the right type and quantity, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.

* Implement cloud financial management
* Adopt consumption model
* Measure overall efficiency
* Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
* Analyze and attribute expenditure

### Sustainability Pillar

The sustainability pillar focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads. Key topics include a shared responsibility model for sustainability, understanding impact, and maximizing utilization to minimize required resources and reduce downstream impacts.

* Understand your impact
* Establish sustainability goals
* Maximize utilization
* Antecipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
* Use managed services
* Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads.

* Use minimum optimum amount of hardware for running resources in AWS cloud.
