# WAF

Can protect `CloudFront`, `API Gateway`, `Application Load Balancer` and `AppSync`.

AWS WAF is tightly integrated with Amazon CloudFront and the Application Load Balancer (ALB), services that AWS customers commonly use to deliver content for their websites and applications. `When you use AWS WAF on Amazon CloudFront, your rules run in all AWS Edge Locations, located around the world close to your end-users`. This means security doesnâ€™t come at the expense of performance. Blocked requests are stopped before they reach your web servers. `When you use AWS WAF on Application Load Balancer, your rules run in the region and can be used to protect internet-facing as well as internal load balancers.`
