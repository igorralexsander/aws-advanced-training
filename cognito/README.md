## Cognito User Pools



## Cognito Identity Pools

Identity pools provide AWS credentials to grant your users access to other AWS services. To enable users in your user pool to access AWS resources, you can configure an identity pool to exchange user pool tokens for AWS credentials. So, identity pools aren't an authentication mechanism in themselves and hence aren't a choice for this use case.
